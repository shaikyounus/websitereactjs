A low-code enterprise news and content management platform developed using Mendix to deliver real-time news publishing, content moderation, and personalized article distribution through secure, scalable workflows.

The application allows content editors to publish and manage news articles, administrators to approve and moderate content, and end users to browse categorized news, search articles, and view real-time updates. Automated microflows control article publishing, approval workflows, and notification triggers, ensuring fast and reliable content delivery.

The platform integrates with external news APIs using REST (JSON) for real-time content ingestion, implements role-based security for Admin, Editor, and Reader users, and uses optimized domain models and XPath queries for high performance. This solution demonstrates enterprise-grade workflow automation, data security, and system integration using Mendix.
