A full-stack news and content management platform designed and developed using a Java-based backend and Android frontend to deliver real-time news publishing, moderation, and personalized content distribution through secure and scalable APIs.

The application enables content editors to create and manage news articles, administrators to review and approve content, and end users to browse categorized news, search articles, and receive real-time updates through the mobile application. Backend services handle publishing workflows, approval logic, and notification triggers to ensure reliable and timely content delivery.

The platform integrates with external news provider APIs using RESTful services and JSON-based data exchange for real-time content ingestion. It implements role-based access control for Admin, Editor, and Reader users, and leverages optimized relational database schemas and indexed queries in SQL Server for performance and scalability. This project demonstrates full-stack development expertise in backend service design, API integration, security, and mobile application support.
