A Court Case Management System designed to simplify interactions between clients, lawyers, and administrators through an intuitive and accessible digital interface.

The platform focuses on streamlining legal workflows — allowing clients to easily register complaints, select lawyers, and track case updates in real time. The design ensures clarity and trust through a clean layout, visual hierarchy, and simplified navigation for users with varying technical backgrounds.

Lawyers benefit from a tailored dashboard that helps manage assigned cases, invoices, and schedules efficiently. Administrators have an organized control panel to update hearing dates, assign courts, and oversee lawyer activities.

This project highlights a user-centered design approach, built around accessibility, responsiveness, and intuitive data visualization — ensuring all stakeholders can navigate complex legal information effortlessly across devices.
