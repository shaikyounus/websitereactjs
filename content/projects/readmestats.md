A full-stack Court Case Management System designed and implemented to digitize and streamline the end-to-end lifecycle of legal cases, including case registration, lawyer assignment, hearing scheduling, document management, and administrative operations through secure, scalable backend services.

The system enables clients to submit complaints, upload supporting documents, track case status, and receive real-time updates through a web-based interface. Lawyers access role-specific dashboards to manage assigned cases, hearing schedules, and billing details, while administrators oversee court assignments, hearing calendars, user access controls, and overall system configuration.

Backend services implement workflow orchestration to manage case progression, hearing state transitions, and notification triggers. The platform enforces role-based access control for Clients, Lawyers, and Administrators, integrates with external systems via RESTful APIs and JSON-based data exchange, and uses optimized relational database schemas in SQL Server for performance and data integrity. This project demonstrates strong software engineering capabilities in backend system design, secure API development, workflow automation, and enterprise-grade case management solutions.
