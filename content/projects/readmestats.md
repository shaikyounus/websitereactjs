A low-code Court Case Management System developed using Mendix to digitally manage legal cases, client requests, lawyer assignments, hearings, and administrative workflows through secure, scalable business processes.

The application enables clients to register complaints, track case status, upload documents, and receive real-time updates. Lawyers use role-based dashboards to manage assigned cases, hearing schedules, and invoices. Administrators control court assignments, hearing dates, user access, and overall system operations through automated microflows.

The system implements end-to-end workflow automation using microflows, role-based access control for Clients, Lawyers, and Admins, and optimized domain models with XPath queries for high performance. It also integrates with external systems using REST APIs (JSON) for notifications and document exchange. This solution demonstrates enterprise-grade process automation, security, and case lifecycle management using Mendix.
