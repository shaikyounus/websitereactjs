I developed a web project using PHP and MySQL.

Then this web project is deployed using AWS cloud EC2 instance.

We can use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk for static PHP application deployment. 

As my project is dynamic, in this project Court Case Management System, we have used an EC2 instance to deploy AWS Cloud.
