A cloud-based application deployment and monitoring platform designed and implemented using Java and AWS services to manage application deployments, system health, and resource utilization in a scalable and secure cloud environment.

The platform enables administrators and operators to deploy applications on AWS EC2, monitor application availability, track CPU and memory utilization, and manage environment-level configurations through secure role-based dashboards. Backend services handle deployment status tracking, health checks, and alert notifications to ensure system reliability and operational visibility.

The application integrates with AWS services using RESTful APIs and JSON-based data exchange to retrieve real-time infrastructure metrics and operational data. It implements role-based access control for Admin and Operator roles and uses optimized relational database schemas in SQL Server for configuration and audit data. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure management, backend service development, AWS monitoring, and secure system automation.
