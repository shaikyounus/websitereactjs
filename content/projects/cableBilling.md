A web-based cloud management interface conceptualized and designed to simplify the deployment and monitoring of web projects on AWS. The focus of the project was to create an intuitive, visually clear dashboard that allows users to easily understand deployment status, resource utilization, and system health.

The design process emphasized clarity, responsiveness, and accessibility, ensuring seamless usability across various screen sizes and devices. Prototyped in Figma and Adobe XD, the layout and interactions were structured to provide real-time visibility for both technical and non-technical users.

Deployed using AWS EC2, the interface demonstrates how effective UI/UX design principles can enhance user interaction even within cloud infrastructure environments.
