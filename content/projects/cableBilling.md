A low-code cloud deployment and monitoring platform developed using Mendix to manage application deployments, system health, and resource utilization on AWS infrastructure through secure, scalable workflows.

The platform enables administrators to deploy applications on AWS EC2, monitor application status, track CPU and memory usage, and manage environment-level configurations through role-based dashboards. Automated microflows handle deployment status updates, health checks, and alert notifications for system failures.

The application integrates with AWS services using REST APIs (JSON) to fetch real-time infrastructure metrics, applies role-based access control for Admin and Operator roles, and uses optimized domain models with XPath queries for high performance. The solution demonstrates enterprise-grade cloud monitoring, automation, and integration using Mendix on AWS.
