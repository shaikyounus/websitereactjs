A voice-to-visual assistive interface designed to enhance accessibility and information delivery in public spaces such as railway stations. The system converts real-time voice announcements into visual text displays on LCD screens, ensuring that hearing-impaired individuals and non-native speakers can easily receive critical information.

The project focused on inclusive design and multimodal interaction, combining voice recognition technology with clear, legible, and high-contrast visual layouts. Prototyped in Figma and Adobe XD, emphasizing readability, color contrast, and spatial hierarchy for visibility in busy environments.

This project showcases how UI/UX design principles can bridge accessibility gaps and make public information systems more inclusive and user-friendly.
