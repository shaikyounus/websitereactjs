A software-driven voice-to-visual accessibility system designed and implemented to convert real-time voice announcements into visual text displays for public environments such as railway stations. The solution improves accessibility for hearing-impaired users and non-native speakers by delivering critical information through synchronized visual channels.

The system processes live audio streams using speech-to-text services, transforms recognized speech into structured text data, and distributes updates to connected display clients through RESTful APIs and real-time messaging. Backend services handle message ingestion, processing, and formatting to ensure low-latency and reliable updates.

The application presents announcements on LCD and web-based displays using accessible, high-contrast layouts aligned with WCAG guidelines. This project demonstrates software engineering skills in real-time data processing, API integration, accessibility-focused system design, and full-stack delivery for public information systems.
