- Worked on the Donate Kart project, which is an online donation platform created utilizing the PHP
programming language and the MySQL database.
- Developed HTML and CSS for the front end (mainly using Bootstrap and CodePen).
PHP is used to design a campaign and authenticate donor information on the login/signup page. MySQL is used
to store campaign, donor, and user information.
