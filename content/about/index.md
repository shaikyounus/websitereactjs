Hello! I'm Younus, a Mendix Developer with 8+ years of experience designing, developing, and supporting enterprise low-code applications in the insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, and financial industries. I specialize in building scalable Mendix applications, integrating backend systems, and automating complex business workflows using microflows, domain models, and API integrations.

My expertise includes end-to-end Mendix development — from requirement analysis, data modeling, UI configuration, and microflow logic to production support, performance optimization, and deployment activities across multi-environment pipelines. I work extensively with SQL, XML/XSD, REST APIs, ITIL processes, and enterprise support tools such as ServiceNow and FootPrints.

I have delivered solutions for major clients including Siemens, Zurich Insurance, and ConocoPhillips — improving operational efficiency, automating manual processes, and modernizing legacy systems. I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams in Agile/Scrum environments to ensure high-quality, reliable, and maintainable Mendix applications.

I enjoy solving complex workflow problems and transforming business requirements into stable, production-ready Mendix solutions.
