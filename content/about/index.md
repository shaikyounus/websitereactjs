  Senior Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience designing, building,
  and operating enterprise-grade applications across cloud-native and
  low-code-enabled platforms. I specialize in scalable backend systems,
  enterprise application modernization, and solution architecture using
  Java, Spring Boot, and distributed microservices.

  I have extensive experience delivering production-grade systems for
  large-scale e-commerce, manufacturing, and industrial environments,
  focusing on reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability.
  My background includes domain-driven design, API-first architectures,
  and the modernization of legacy platforms through modular, service-based
  solutions.

  Alongside deep backend engineering expertise in Java (8–17), Spring Boot,
  and GraphQL, I have built and integrated low-code enterprise applications
  with core platforms using REST, SOAP, and event-driven integrations.
  This allows me to bridge business workflows with robust backend services
  while maintaining strong security, scalability, and operational standards.

  I am known for collaborating closely with cross-functional teams,
  mentoring engineers, and delivering well-architected systems that
  support global users, complex integrations, and continuous delivery.
