Hello! I'm Younus, a UI/UX Developer with over a decade of experience crafting intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging digital products. I specialize in designing and developing user-centered interfaces that balance aesthetics, usability, and performance across web and mobile platforms.

I blend creative design thinking with front-end development expertise to deliver pixel-perfect, production-ready solutions. My workflow bridges the gap between design and code — from user research, wireframing, and prototyping in Figma/Adobe XD to building responsive, scalable interfaces using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

I’ve collaborated with cross-functional teams in Agile/Scrum environments to design enterprise dashboards, e-commerce platforms, and SaaS applications — optimizing user journeys and improving accessibility (WCAG standards). My approach focuses on empathy-driven design, iterative testing, and crafting seamless experiences that delight users and drive business outcomes.

I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant designs that make users’ lives easier and more engaging.
