A low-code real estate automation platform developed using Mendix to digitize property listings, client inquiries, and realtor lead management through secure, scalable business workflows.

The application enables buyers to browse real-time property listings, apply dynamic filters, view property details, and submit instant inquiries through automated microflows. Sellers can securely post and manage property listings with validation rules and approval workflows. Realtors benefit from centralized lead tracking, inquiry automation, and role-based dashboards for managing client interactions and sales pipelines.

The platform integrates with external systems using REST APIs (JSON) for data synchronization, implements role-based access control for buyers, sellers, and realtors, and uses optimized domain models and XPath queries for high performance and scalability. The solution demonstrates enterprise-grade workflow automation, security, and integration capabilities using Mendix.
