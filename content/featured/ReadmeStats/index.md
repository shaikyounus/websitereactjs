A full-stack real estate automation platform designed and implemented to digitize property listings, client inquiries, and realtor lead management through secure, scalable backend services and API-driven workflows.

The application enables buyers to browse real-time property listings, apply dynamic filters, view detailed property information, and submit instant inquiries through automated backend workflows. Sellers can securely create, update, and manage property listings with validation rules and approval logic, while realtors use role-based dashboards to track leads, manage inquiries, and oversee sales pipelines.

The platform integrates with external systems using RESTful APIs and JSON-based data exchange for data synchronization and notifications. It enforces role-based access control for buyers, sellers, and realtors, and leverages optimized relational database schemas in SQL Server to ensure performance, scalability, and data integrity. This project demonstrates strong software engineering skills in backend system design, secure API development, workflow orchestration, and enterprise-grade real estate platform development.
