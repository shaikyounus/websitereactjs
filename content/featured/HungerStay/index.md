Swarm Robotics deals with Artificial Swarm Intelligence between multiple robots.
The robots communicate and coordinate among themselves and complete a mission.
Imagine an aerial robot (drone) seeing a survivor of ship wreck and informing a sea robot that is closest to the person to rescue.
Thats swarm robots in action!
